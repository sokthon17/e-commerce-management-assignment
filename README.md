E-Commerce Management Dashboard
This is a Next.js project for an E-Commerce Management Dashboard built as an assignment based on a Figma design
The project fetches product data dynamically from the DummyJSON API

ðŸ›  Tech Stack
Next.js 13+ (App Router) â€“ modern React framework with SSR/SSG support
TypeScript â€“ for type safety
React â€“ UI library
Tailwind CSS â€“ for styling and responsive design
DummyJSON API â€“ for product and category data
next/font â€“ optimized font loading with Geist

ðŸš€ Getting Started

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

### Run the project

Make sure you install the packages

```sh
npm install
```

Start the Nextjs development asset server by running:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, which will purge the server require cache when Remix rebuilds assets so you don't need a process manager restarting the express server. You can access the website by going to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## E2E Testing

This project already includes end to end testing with [playwright](https://playwright.dev/)

All the test cases need to be inside the `tests` directory that is located in the root folder of the project.

For every commit to BitBucket the default pipeline will run and the E2E testing is part of that pipeline.

### Create a new test case

Create a new file and the file should be ending with `.test.ts` to be recognized and run. This is the default template for a test case

```ts
import {test, expect} from '@playwright/test';

test.describe('Test Name', () => {
    test('Step N for test', async ({page}) => {
         await page.goto('/') // Go to Homepage: Insert the relative URL you want to test

        const title = await page.locator(`title`).textContent() // You can use JS locators like ( tag / .className / #id ) to locate content
        expect(title).toEqual('Hello World')
    })
})
```

### Run testing locally

You can run tests in two ways:

- CLI - will just run in the command line: `npm run e2e`
- UI - will run the test in a view window executing all the steps in the test: `npm run e2e:ui`

You can start editing the pages under app/. The page updates automatically as you make changes.
